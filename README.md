# Axieva Assignment

## Objective

Design and implement a **Spring Boot-based RESTful service** that:

- Reads a large dataset (CSV format) containing student details.
- Stores the data **in memory**.
- Creates an **index based on student names** to optimize search operations.
- Exposes APIs to **create the index** and **search for students by name**.

---

## Dataset

- **Format:** CSV file  
- **Record Count:** Approximately **100,000** student records  
- **Columns (5 fields):**
  - `ID` (String)
  - `Name` (String)
  - `Age` (Integer)
  - `Class` (String)
  - `Grade` (String)

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Create Index API

- **Method:** `POST`  
- **Endpoint:** `/index`  
- **Description:**
  - Parses the CSV file.
  - Stores student records in memory.
  - Creates an in-memory index on the `Name` field using a suitable data structure:
    ```java
    Map<String, List<Student>>
    ```
  - Parsing and indexing should be performed using **multithreading** for better performance.

### 2. Search API

- **Method:** `GET`  
- **Endpoint:** `/search`  
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `name` (String)
  - `mode` (optional, `linear` or `index`; default is `index`)  
- **Description:**
  - Searches for student records by name.
  - Supports two search modes:
    - **linear**: Performs a linear search through all records.
    - **index**: Uses the in-memory index for optimized search.
  - Returns a list of matching student records.

---

## Technical Requirements

- Use **Java** and **Spring Boot** framework.
- No use of external databases ‚Äî all data should reside **in memory**.
- Utilize **multithreading** during CSV parsing to improve performance.
- Maintain proper **separation of concerns** (`Controller`, `Service`, `Model` layers).
- **Optional:** Log or compare performance between linear search and index-based search.

---

## Deliverables

- Complete **Spring Boot project** (source code).
- **Sample CSV file** (or support for uploading/reading file path).
- **API documentation** (endpoints and usage).
- **README** with steps to run and test the application.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctness** and **completeness** of the implementation.
- **Code structure** and **clarity**.
- Use of appropriate **data structures** for indexing.
- Effective use of **multithreading**.
- **REST API design** following best practices.

---

## Project Documentation

### About Dataset

- Dataset is generated using a **Python script** utilizing the `random` module.

### Source Format

- **File Type:** CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Filename (example):** `students.csv`
- **Location:**  
  - Placed in `src/main/resources/`  
  - Or loaded via **absolute file path** or **file upload**

### Record Volume

The dataset contains approximately **100,000** student records, simulating a **large-scale data** scenario for testing performance, indexing, and in-memory storage efficiency.

---

### Schema / Columns

| Column Name | Data Type | Description                   | Example        |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| ID          | Integer   | Unique identifier             | `3`            |
| Name        | String    | Full name of the student      | `Amit Sharma`  |
| Age         | Integer   | Age of the student            | `16`           |
| Class       | String    | Class and section             | `10A`          |
| Grade       | String    | Academic grade                | `A`, `B+`      |

---

## Architecture

The system follows a simple layered architecture:

- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and maps them to service methods.
- **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic for loading, indexing, and searching student data.
- **Model Layer**: Defines the `Student` entity used for data storage.
- **Indexing**: Uses a `ConcurrentHashMap` to store lowercase student names as keys for fast retrieval.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes Java `ForkJoinPool` for multi-threaded CSV parsing.

## Algorithms Used for Searching

- **Linear Search**: Iterates through the entire list of students to find matches (O(n)).
- **Index Search**: Uses a pre-built `ConcurrentHashMap` to look up students by lowercase exact name (O(1)).
- **Prefix Search**: Scans index keys to find matches starting with the given prefix (O(k), where k = number of unique names).

---

## API Endpoints

1. **POST `/index`** - Build index from CSV file  
   - Params: `csvPath` (optional)  
   - Response: Stats about loading and indexing  

2. **GET `/search`** - Search students by exact name  
   - Params: `name` (required), `mode` (`linear` or `index`)  
   - Response: List of matching students  

3. **GET `/search-prefix`** - Search students by name prefix  
   - Params: `prefix` (required)  
   - Response: List of matching students  

4. **GET `/debug-index`** - Return the complete index map (for debugging)

## üöÄ Steps to Use

### üì¶ Build the Project

```bash
mvn clean package
````

Generates a JAR in `target/` (e.g. `student-search-inmemory-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`)

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the JAR

```bash
java -jar target/student-search-inmemory-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

---

### üåê Open the App in Browser

Visit: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
(Full frontend + backend served from the same place)

---

### üîß Use the App

* **Default behavior**: If no CSV path is provided, it uses the `students.csv` file in the `resources` directory.
* **Custom CSV**: You can input an **absolute file path** to use your own CSV file.

---

## üß™ Instructions

### **Step A** ‚Äî Build Index

1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Optionally enter a full file path (e.g., `D:\Data\my_students.csv`)
3. Click **"Build Index"**
4. Backend reads and parses the CSV, then builds the in-memory index (multi-threaded)

Sample stats:

```
Rows: 100000
Unique names: 100
Parse: 54 ms
Index: 33 ms
```

---

### **Step B** ‚Äî Search Students

1. Enter a **name** or **prefix**
2. Choose search mode:

   * `linear`: scans all records
   * `index`: uses the in-memory map
3. Choose match type:

   * `exact`: matches full name
   * `prefix`: matches name starting with prefix
4. Click **Search**
5. Results will be shown in a table
